## 🗂️ Project Structure & Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** This project has a specific directory structure. Always follow these rules:

### Directory Structure:
```
AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler/          ← Main git repository
├── README.md                                ← This file
├── CODING_LOG.md
└── ai-tweet-scheduler/                      ← Next.js app directory
    ├── src/
    ├── package.json
    └── ... (all your app files)
```

### Git Workflow Rules:
🚨 **ALWAYS run git commands from the ROOT directory:**
- ✅ **Correct:** `/AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler/`
- ❌ **Wrong:** `/AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler/ai-tweet-scheduler/`

### Commands to Remember:
```bash
# Always start here:
cd AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler

# Then run git commands:
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main

# For npm commands, go into the app directory:
cd ai-tweet-scheduler && npm run dev
```

### Quick Check Commands:
```bash
pwd                    # Should show: /path/to/AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler
git status             # Should work without errors
ls                     # Should show: README.md, ai-tweet-scheduler/, etc.
```

## ✅ Your MVP Checklist

Here is your roadmap to building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We've broken it down into four phases.

### Phase 1: The Foundation - Backend & Basic UI ✅ **COMPLETED**

This phase is about setting up the core of our application. We'll get our database ready, allow users to sign up and log in, and build the basic interface for generating tweets.

*   [x] **Set up your Supabase Project:**
    *   [x] Go to [Supabase.io](https://supabase.io) and create a new project.
    *   [x] Keep your project URL and `anon` key handy. We'll need them soon.

*   [x] **Create Your Database Tables:**
    *   [x] In your Supabase project, go to the Table Editor.
    *   [x] Create a `users` table to store user information (Supabase might handle this for you with Auth).
    *   [x] Create a `tweets` table with columns like `id`, `user_id`, `tweet_content`, `status` (e.g., 'draft', 'scheduled', 'posted'), and `scheduled_at`.

*   [x] **Set up your Next.js Frontend:**
    *   [x] Open your terminal and run `npx create-next-app@latest ai-tweet-scheduler`.
    *   [x] `cd ai-tweet-scheduler` to go into your new project directory.
    *   [x] Install the Supabase library: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`.

*   [x] **Connect Next.js to Supabase:**
    *   [x] Create a new file in your project to initialize the Supabase client using the keys from the first step.

*   [x] **Build User Authentication:** ✅ TESTED & WORKING
    *   [x] Create a Sign-Up page.
    *   [x] Create a Login page.
    *   [x] Implement a Logout button.
    *   [x] Test complete signup → email confirmation → login flow.
    *   (Hint: Use the official Supabase examples for Next.js, they are excellent!)

*   [x] **Create the Tweet Composer:**
    *   [x] Create a new page that's only visible to logged-in users.
    *   [x] Add a simple text box (`<textarea>`) for writing or editing tweets.
    *   [x] Add a button that says "Generate with AI".
    *   [x] Add a "Save Draft" button.

*   [x] **Integrate OpenAI:**
    *   [x] Sign up for an OpenAI API key.
    *   [x] When a user clicks "Generate with AI", send a request to the OpenAI API with a prompt.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "Write a short, witty tweet about the challenges of being a startup founder."
    *   [x] Display the AI-generated text in the text box.

*   [x] **Save Drafts:**
    *   [x] When the "Save Draft" button is clicked, save the content of the text box to your `tweets` table in Supabase.

*   [x] **Draft Management:**
    *   [x] View all saved drafts in a list
    *   [x] Load drafts back into the composer for editing
    *   [x] Delete drafts
    *   [x] Character count display (280 character limit)

## 🔧 **Current Scheduling Approach**

### **What Works Now:**
1. **Schedule tweets** with date/time picker
2. **View scheduled tweets** in dashboard
3. **Manual posting** with "🚀 Post Now" button
4. **Full tweet management** (edit, cancel, delete)

### **Scheduling Options:**

#### **Option A: Manual Control (Current - Recommended)**
- ✅ Users schedule tweets for organization
- ✅ Users manually post when ready using "🚀 Post Now"
- ✅ Full control over timing
- ✅ No additional setup required

#### **Option B: Automated Posting (Requires Setup)**
- ❌ Requires `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
- ❌ Tweets post automatically every 5 minutes
- ❌ Less user control over exact timing
- ❌ Additional complexity

### **Recommendation:** 
**Stick with Option A (Manual Control)** - Many users prefer having control over when their tweets actually go out, especially for important content. The current system provides excellent scheduling organization with the safety of manual approval.
