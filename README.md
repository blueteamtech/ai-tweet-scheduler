*   [x] **Create Your Database Tables:**
    *   [x] In your Supabase project, go to the Table Editor.
    *   [x] Create a `users` table to store user information (Supabase might handle this for you with Auth).
    *   [x] Create a `tweets` table with columns like `id`, `user_id`, `tweet_content`, `status` (e.g., 'draft', 'scheduled', 'posted'), and `scheduled_at`.

*   [x] **Set up your Next.js Frontend:**
    *   [x] Open your terminal and run `npx create-next-app@latest ai-tweet-scheduler`.
    *   [x] `cd ai-tweet-scheduler` to go into your new project directory.
    *   [x] Install the Supabase library: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`.

    *   (Hint: Use the official Supabase examples for Next.js, they are excellent!)

*   [x] **Create the Tweet Composer:**
    *   [x] Create a new page that's only visible to logged-in users.
    *   [x] Add a simple text box (`<textarea>`) for writing or editing tweets.
    *   [x] Add a button that says "Generate with AI".
    *   [x] Add a "Save Draft" button.

*   [x] **Integrate OpenAI:**
    *   [x] Sign up for an OpenAI API key.
    *   [x] When a user clicks "Generate with AI", send a request to the OpenAI API with a prompt.
    *   **Example Prompt:** "Write a short, witty tweet about the challenges of being a startup founder."
    *   [x] Display the AI-generated text in the text box.

*   [x] **Save Drafts:**
    *   [x] When the "Save Draft" button is clicked, save the content of the text box to your `tweets` table in Supabase.
