  - Preserve bullet points: `- Key insight` (keep)
  - Preserve internal quotes: `He said "yes"` (keep)
- [ ] **Step 1.4:** Basic Rate Limiting
  - Implement simple rate limiting (max 20 tweets/user/hour)
  - Add basic input validation (max length, content filtering)
  - Test rate limiting under normal usage
- [ ] **Step 1.5:** Integration Testing
  - Test expanded templates + all samples + cleaning working together
  - Verify no breaking changes to existing functionality
  - Test rate limiting works properly

### **🧪 Phase 1 Testing Checklist:**
