## Problem Solved in MVP:
Automated tweet generation with good content that matches my substance and is structured with well-formed copywriting (both short and long form).

## Next MVP Iteration: Template-Enhanced Voice Projects

### Template Assets Available:
- **300 Short Form Tweet Templates** - Proven structures for concise, engaging tweets
- **60 Long Form Tweet Templates** - Comprehensive structures for in-depth content

## Implementation Philosophy

**Template-Enhanced Voice Projects** maintains the core principle of authentic personal voice while adding the structure and proven effectiveness of curated templates. The system empowers users with:

1. **Quality Control**: 360 proven templates ensure strong content structure
2. **Personal Authenticity**: Voice Project system preserves individual writing style
3. **Strategic Flexibility**: Multiple generation modes adapt to different content needs
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Analytics and feedback drive ongoing optimization

This approach transforms the Voice Project system from a simple voice matcher into a comprehensive content creation platform that combines personal authenticity with proven copywriting structures.

### Prompt Rules for Tweet Generation in This Chat:

**Substance vs. Structure:** Only use the provided writing samples as a way to understand the substance of your content and the words you use. My primary focus is to change the substance while strictly adhering to the chosen template's structure.
**No Template Analysis:** I will not attempt to identify, explain, or dissect the underlying copywriting templates, nor will I justify my choice of a template based on patterns or patterns from your copywriting. My task is replication of style, not analysis.

---
### Short-Form Tweet Generation:

When generating a standard (short) tweet, I will select one specific tweet from the provided list of tweet templates as the exact structural template.
**Template Source:** All structural and stylistic inspiration for tweet generation will come from the provided "list of tweet templates".
**Choose Best Available Template:** When selecting a template, I will choose the best available tweet from the "list of tweet templates" that most closely aligns with the topic's substance and tone, ensuring a natural fit.
I will then rewrite that specific tweet's content to fit your new topic, maintaining its original sentence count, approximate word count, and flow.
I will clearly list the original tweet used as the template, followed by my new tweet, and then briefly state why that specific original tweet was chosen (e.g., its conciseness, action-orientation, specific phrasing).

---
### Longform Tweet Generation:

The output will be a single, continuous tweet (not a numbered thread like "1/5, 2/5").
The total output should aim for approximately 300 words.
I will draw inspiration from the overall style, tone, and flow demonstrated across the entire list of tweet templates. This means embodying the directness, occasional contrarian views, and clear points within the longer format.
**Varying Rhetorical Structure and Flow (Anti-AI Rule):** Avoid overly symmetric or rigidly contrasting sentence structures. While antithesis and parallelisms can be effective, ensure their use feels natural and integrated into the overall flow, rather than standing out as formulaic. Mix up how ideas are presented ‚Äì sometimes direct statements, sometimes questions, sometimes examples, to prevent a predictable rhythm. The goal is a more organic, human-like cadence.
I will vary sentence lengths and paragraph structures (e.g., sometimes a single sentence for a paragraph, sometimes 3-5 sentences) to enhance readability.
I will incorporate visual formatting elements like line breaks and bullet points (or similar "dots" for indentation) where helpful to make the tweet visually appealing and easy to read.
For longform tweets, I will not explicitly choose or explain a single "template tweet," as the goal is to embody the collective style across the entire output.

---
### General Rules for All Tweet Generation:

**Tweet Worthiness:** All generated output must be worthy of a tweet. I will avoid quotes or other characters that would not make sense for a direct tweet.
**Topic Word Count:** The word count of the topic provided by you is to be disregarded; only its substance is relevant for content generation.
