# AI Tweet Scheduler - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is a beginner-friendly SaaS project building an AI-powered tweet scheduler. The user is learning to code and needs clear explanations and step-by-step guidance.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (database + auth)
- AI: OpenAI API
- Payments: Stripe
- Deployment: Vercel

## Development Guidelines

### For the AI Assistant:
1. **Always explain what you're doing** - Don't just write code, explain why
2. **Use beginner-friendly language** - Avoid jargon without explanation
3. **Show file structure** - Help the user understand where files go
4. **Provide context** - Explain how each piece fits into the bigger picture
5. **Include error handling** - Show proper error handling patterns
6. **Use TypeScript properly** - Define types and interfaces clearly
7. **Follow Next.js 14 App Router patterns** - Use modern Next.js conventions

### Code Standards:
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow Next.js App Router structure
- Use proper error boundaries
- Include loading states
- Add proper TypeScript types
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Follow React best practices (hooks, components)

### File Organization:
```
ai-tweet-scheduler/
├── src/
│   ├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── components/          # Reusable React components
│   ├── lib/                # Utility functions, API clients
│   ├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
│   └── styles/             # Global styles
├── public/                 # Static assets
└── ...config files
```

### When Writing Code:
1. Always include proper TypeScript types
2. Add comments explaining complex logic
3. Use meaningful variable and function names
4. Include error handling and loading states
5. Make components reusable when possible
6. Follow the principle of separation of concerns

### For Database Design:
- Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
- Create proper foreign key relationships
- Use meaningful table and column names
- Include created_at and updated_at timestamps
- **ALWAYS check database-schema.md before making database assumptions**
- Current tables: `tweets`, `user_twitter_accounts` (see database-schema.md for full details)

### Security Best Practices:
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Use Supabase RLS for data security
- Validate all user inputs

### When Helping the User:
1. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
2. Explain the "why" behind each decision
3. Show examples of how to test the code
4. Provide debugging tips when things go wrong
5. Reference the README.md checklist to track progress
6. Suggest best practices for each feature
7. **Environment Files**: Cannot read .env.local files for security reasons - always assume they exist and are configured correctly when user says they are

### 🚨 CRITICAL GIT WORKFLOW RULES:
8. **Git Commands Directory**: ALWAYS run git commands from the ROOT directory `/AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler/`, NEVER from `/ai-tweet-scheduler/`
9. **Git Workflow**: Always use `cd AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler && git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push origin main`
10. **Directory Check**: Before git commands, always run `pwd` to confirm you're in the root directory
11. **NPM vs Git**: NPM commands run from `/ai-tweet-scheduler/`, Git commands run from `/AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler/`
12. **Directory Reminder**: The user's terminal may be in a different directory than the AI's shell. Always remind them:
    - For Git: "In YOUR terminal, run: cd AI-Personality-Tweets-to-Scheduler && git add . && git commit && git push"
    - For NPM: "In YOUR terminal, run: cd ai-tweet-scheduler && npm run dev"

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid:
- Not handling loading and error states
- Exposing secrets in client-side code
- Not using TypeScript properly
- Not following Next.js conventions
- Not implementing proper error boundaries
- Not using environment variables
- Not securing API routes

Remember: This is a learning project, so prioritize clarity and education over brevity.
