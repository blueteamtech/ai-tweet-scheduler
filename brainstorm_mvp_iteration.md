## Prompt Rules for Short Form Tweet Generation:

**Substance vs. Structure:** Only use the provided writing samples as a way to understand the substance of your content and the words you use. Primary focus is to change the substance while strictly adhering to the chosen template's structure.

**No Template Analysis:** Will not attempt to identify, explain, or dissect the underlying copywriting templates, nor justify choice of template based on patterns. Task is replication of style, not analysis.

**Template Selection & Generation:**
- Select one specific tweet from the provided list of 300 tweet templates as the exact structural template
- **Template Source:** All structural and stylistic inspiration comes from the provided "list of tweet templates"
- **Choose Best Available Template:** Select the template that most closely aligns with the topic's substance and tone
- Rewrite that specific tweet's content to fit the new topic, maintaining original sentence count, approximate word count, and flow
- Clearly list the original tweet used as template, followed by new tweet, then briefly state why that specific original tweet was chosen

**General Rules:**
- **Tweet Worthiness:** All generated output must be worthy of a tweet
- **Topic Word Count:** Disregard word count of topic provided; only substance is relevant for content generation
