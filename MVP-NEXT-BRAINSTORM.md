  - Fix hard-to-read text in edit modes
  - Enhanced typography and spacing in all text areas

- [ ] **Automated Debug Scripts (No Bearer Token Required)**
  - `/api/debug/system-health` - Check all service connections
  - `/api/debug/queue-validation` - Validate queue logic without auth
  - `/api/debug/ui-components` - Test component rendering
  - Cursor IDE-friendly test runner script

**Testing Criteria:**
- [ ] All unused features removed without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] Interface readability significantly improved
- [ ] Debug scripts run successfully from Cursor IDE
- [ ] No authentication required for debug endpoints

### **Phase 2: Queue Management Enhancement**
*Duration: 1-2 weeks | Focus: Real-time User Experience*

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Responsive Queue Management**
  - Auto-refresh queue after adding tweets
  - Real-time updates without manual refresh
  - Loading states and error handling

- [ ] **Tweet Editing in Queue**
  - Edit queued tweets before scheduling
  - Modify content without re-queuing
  - Save changes in real-time

**Automated Debug Scripts:**
- [ ] `/api/debug/queue-realtime` - Test real-time queue updates
- [ ] `/api/debug/edit-simulation` - Simulate tweet editing workflow
- [ ] `/api/debug/queue-consistency` - Verify queue state consistency

**Testing Criteria:**
- [ ] Queue updates immediately after adding tweets
- [ ] Tweet editing works seamlessly in queue
- [ ] No data loss during editing operations
- [ ] Real-time updates work across browser tabs

### **Phase 3: Advanced Content Management**
*Duration: 2-3 weeks | Focus: Content Creation Features*

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Thread Support with Smart Character Management**
  - Automatic character limit detection
  - Smart thread splitting and continuation
  - Preview thread before queuing

- [ ] **Long-form Tweet Option**
  - Alternative to threads for longer content
  - Single extended tweet format
  - User choice between thread vs long-form

**Automated Debug Scripts:**
- [ ] `/api/debug/character-counting` - Test character limit logic
- [ ] `/api/debug/thread-splitting` - Validate thread creation algorithm
- [ ] `/api/debug/content-formatting` - Test both thread and long-form outputs

**Testing Criteria:**
- [ ] Character counting is accurate across all content types
- [ ] Thread splitting creates logical, readable breaks
- [ ] Long-form tweets format correctly
- [ ] User can preview before committing to queue

### **Phase 4: AI Integration Expansion**
*Duration: 2-3 weeks | Focus: Multiple AI Providers*

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Multiple AI Integration**
  - Integrate Claude API for tweet composition
  - Add Grok option for different writing styles
  - User choice between AI providers
  - Fallback system if primary AI fails

**Automated Debug Scripts:**
- [ ] `/api/debug/ai-providers` - Test all AI provider connections
- [ ] `/api/debug/ai-fallback` - Test fallback system
- [ ] `/api/debug/ai-style-comparison` - Compare outputs from different AIs

**Testing Criteria:**
- [ ] All AI providers integrate successfully
- [ ] User can switch between providers seamlessly
- [ ] Fallback system works when primary AI is unavailable
- [ ] Output quality is consistent across providers
