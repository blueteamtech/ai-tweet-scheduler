# 🚀 MVP 3.0 - Development Checklist

**Target Launch:** July 14, 2025 (2 weeks from June 28)  
**Goal:** Make AI tweets more human and viral with smart template matching, 10 relevant voice samples, Grok integration, and reliable payments  
**Strategy:** Phase-based development with clear deliverables and testing

---

## 🚦 **PHASE 1: AI-POWERED TEMPLATE MATCHING & VOICE SAMPLES**
*Deliverable: AI automatically picks best template + 10 most relevant voice samples for each tweet*

### **🎯 AI Algorithm Improvements:**
- **Smart Template Selection:** AI analyzes tweet idea content type, picks best template (vs random LRU)
- **10 Relevant Voice Samples:** AI matches tweet idea to most relevant writing samples (vs last 5)
- **Smart Output Cleaning:** Remove unwanted quotes/slashes, preserve intentional formatting

### **✅ Pre-Flight Checklist:**
- [ ] **Database Backup:** Supabase Dashboard → Database → Export full backup with date stamp
- [ ] **Current System Test:** Verify existing template selection works perfectly
- [ ] **Document Current Flow:** Map exactly how LRU template selection works now
- [ ] **Cost Baseline:** Document current AI API spend per user/month
- [ ] **Rate Limit Review:** Verify current rate limiting (10 requests/min per user)

### **📝 Build Steps:**
- [ ] **Step 1.1:** AI Template Categorization Setup
  - Add "content_type" field to tweet_templates table (story, humor, motivational, advice, etc.)
  - Categorize existing templates by content type
  - Test template categorization system
- [ ] **Step 1.2:** 10 AI-Matched Voice Samples System
  - Implement OpenAI embeddings comparison (tweet idea vs all writing samples)
  - Build relevance scoring system (0-1 score per sample)
  - Create top-10 sample selection logic
  - Test sample relevance vs current last-5 approach
- [ ] **Step 1.3:** AI Template Selection Logic

  - Implement smart template matching (content type → best template)
  - Integrate 10 relevant samples into voice prompting
  - Add fallback to LRU if AI fails
- [ ] **Step 1.4:** Smart Output Cleaning
  - Remove wrapper quotes: `"tweet text"` → `tweet text`
  - Fix escaped characters: `It\'s` → `It's`
  - Preserve bullet points: `- Key insight` (keep)
  - Preserve internal quotes: `He said "yes"` (keep)
- [ ] **Step 1.5:** Cost Protection & Security
  - Implement AI call circuit breaker (max 20 calls/user/hour)
  - Add cost monitoring alerts (>$50/day total AI spend)
  - Basic input validation for AI prompts (max length, content filtering)
  - Test rate limiting under load (prevent API abuse)
- [ ] **Step 1.6:** Integration Testing
  - Test AI template + samples + cleaning working together
  - Verify fallback systems work when AI calls fail
  - Test cost protection triggers properly
  - Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

### **🧪 Phase 1 Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Test AI template matching with 20 different tweet ideas (humor, business, personal, etc.)
