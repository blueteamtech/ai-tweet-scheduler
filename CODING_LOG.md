# ðŸ““ Coding Log

This document tracks the development progress and key decisions made during the creation of the AI Tweet Scheduler project. Each entry includes the date, what was done, and why it was important.

---

### Entry 1: Project Initialization & Game Plan (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)

*   **What was done:**
    *   Created the initial `README.md` file.
*   **Why it was done:**
    *   To establish a clear, step-by-step game plan for building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This file serves as our primary checklist and project guide, breaking down the complex process into manageable phases. It's especially useful for a first-time project to keep track of goals and progress.

---

### Entry 2: Version Control & Best Practices Setup (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)

*   **What was done:**
    *   Initialized a Git repository using the `git init` command.
    *   Created a `.gitignore` file tailored for a Next.js project.
    *   Set up a `.github` directory with templates for Pull Requests, Bug Reports, and Feature Requests.
*   **Why it was done:**
    *   **Git Repository:** To track changes to our code over time. This is the foundation of version control, allowing us to save snapshots of our work, revert changes if something breaks, and collaborate effectively.
    *   **`.gitignore`:** To prevent unnecessary or sensitive files (like `node_modules/` or `.env` files containing secret keys) from being saved in our version history. This keeps the repository clean and secure.
    *   **GitHub Templates:** To standardize how we and potential future collaborators contribute to the project. It ensures that bug reports are detailed, feature requests are clear, and code changes (Pull Requests) are well-documented, which is a best practice for any serious project.

### Entry 3: Next.js Project Setup & Environment Configuration (Date: 2025-06-20)

*   **What was done:**
    *   Created Next.js 14 project with TypeScript using `npx create-next-app@latest ai-tweet-scheduler`
    *   Configured project with Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, and src directory structure
    *   Installed Supabase client library with `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
    *   Created organized folder structure: `src/lib/`, `src/types/`, `src/components/`
    *   Set up Supabase client connection in `src/lib/supabase.ts` with TypeScript types
    *   Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`

*   **Why it was done:**
    *   **TypeScript:** Provides type safety and better development experience, catching errors at compile time
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid UI development with utility-first CSS framework
    *   **App Router:** Uses modern Next.js 14 conventions for better performance and developer experience
    *   **Organized Structure:** Separates concerns (utilities, types, components) for maintainable code
    *   **Supabase Integration:** Establishes backend connection for database and authentication services

*   **Key Files Created:**
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Database client and type definitions
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for User, Tweet, and API responses
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/.cursorrules` - Development guidelines for consistent coding practices

### Entry 4: Database Setup & Authentication System (Date: 2025-06-20)

*   **What was done:**
    *   Created Supabase database table `tweets` with proper schema and relationships
    *   Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
    *   Built complete authentication system with sign-up, login, and logout functionality
    *   Created protected dashboard page with authentication guards
    *   Designed responsive landing page with modern UI components
    *   Implemented proper error handling and loading states throughout

*   **Why it was done:**
    *   **Database Schema:** Establishes foundation for storing tweet data with proper relationships to users
    *   **RLS Policies:** Ensures users can only access their own data, providing security by default
    *   **Authentication System:** Core requirement for user management and data isolation
    *   **Protected Routes:** Prevents unauthorized access to application features
    *   **Modern UI:** Creates professional user experience with responsive design

*   **Key Files Created:**
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/src/app/login/page.tsx` - User login interface
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/src/app/signup/page.tsx` - User registration interface  
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Protected main application interface
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/src/app/page.tsx` - Landing page with feature showcase
    *   `ai-tweet-scheduler/database-setup.sql` - Database schema and security policies

### Entry 5: Environment Configuration & Debugging (Date: 2025-06-20)

*   **What was done:**
    *   Resolved critical environment variable configuration issues
    *   Created proper `.env.local` file in correct directory location
    *   Implemented comprehensive debugging system for environment variables
    *   Updated development guidelines in `.cursorrules` for directory navigation
    *   Established proper file structure and permissions for environment files

*   **Why it was done:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Essential for securely connecting to Supabase services
    *   **Proper File Location:** Next.js requires `.env.local` in project root alongside `package.json`
    *   **Debugging System:** Helps identify configuration issues during development
    *   **Directory Guidelines:** Prevents common beginner mistakes with npm command execution
    *   **Security:** Keeps sensitive API keys out of version control while maintaining functionality

*   **Key Lessons Learned:**
    *   Next.js automatically reads `.env.local` files without additional packages
    *   Environment files must be in same directory as `package.json`
    *   Variables must have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access
    *   Directory navigation is critical for npm commands to work properly
